# Komatachi Distillation Progress

> **START HERE** — This file is the source of truth for project state.

## Quick Status

| Aspect | State |
|--------|-------|
| **Phase** | Trial distillation complete; ready for next component |
| **Last completed** | Compaction module distilled (666 → 275 LOC) |
| **Next action** | Choose next component to distill (see "Next Steps" below) |
| **Blockers** | None |

### What Exists Now
- [x] Scouting reports for 4 core areas (~20k LOC analyzed)
- [x] Distillation principles documented (8 principles)
- [x] Trial distillation: `src/compaction/` working

### Open Decision Needed
**Which component to distill next?** Candidates ranked by isolation:
1. Long-term Memory & Search (most isolated)
2. Context Management (builds on compaction)
3. Agent Alignment (defines behavior)
4. Session Management (largest, most interconnected)

This file tracks our progress distilling OpenClaw into Komatachi. Maintaining this file is essential—it provides continuity across sessions, documents what we've learned, and prevents re-discovering the same insights.

**Update this file as work progresses.**

## Completed Work

### 1. Scouting (Complete)

Analyzed four core functional areas of OpenClaw:

| Component | LOC | Files | Complexity | Report |
|-----------|-----|-------|------------|--------|
| Context Management | 2,630 | 15 | HIGH | `scouting/context-management.md` |
| Long-term Memory & Search | 5,713 | 25 | HIGH | `scouting/long-term-memory-search.md` |
| Agent Alignment | 4,261 | 18 | HIGH | `scouting/agent-alignment.md` |
| Session Management | 7,319 | 35+ | HIGH | `scouting/session-management.md` |

**Total**: ~20,000 lines of high-complexity code

### 2. Distillation Principles (Complete)

Established 8 core principles in `DISTILLATION.md`:

1. Preserve the Essential, Remove the Accidental
2. Make State Explicit and Localized
3. Prefer Depth over Breadth
4. Design for Auditability
5. Embrace Constraints
6. Interfaces Over Implementations
7. Fail Clearly, Not Gracefully
8. Respect Layer Boundaries

Also documented:
- The Distillation Test (when to distill, what success looks like)
- Four-phase process (Study → Design → Build → Validate)
- What distillation is NOT (refactoring, porting, optimization)
- Preserving the distilled state (cognitive scaffolding, guards against drift)

### 3. Trial Distillation: Compaction (Complete)

Successfully distilled compaction as a proof of concept:

| Metric | Original | Distilled |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Lines of code | 666 | 275 |
| Hidden state | WeakMap registries | None |
| Chunking | Built-in, adaptive | Caller's responsibility |
| Oversized input | Silent pruning | Throws error |
| Extension hooks | Yes | No |
| Tests needed (est.) | ~50 | ~15-20 |

**Key insight discovered**: The summarizer was handling chunking that wasn't its responsibility (layer boundary violation). Modern 128k+ context models can summarize ~107k tokens in one call—the 40% chunk ratio was a holdover from smaller context windows.

Files created:
- `src/compaction/index.ts` - The distilled implementation
- `src/compaction/DECISIONS.md` - Architectural decision record

### 4. Project Documentation (Complete)

- `CLAUDE.md` - Project context for AI assistants
- `DISTILLATION.md` - Principles and process
- `PROGRESS.md` - This file

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Single embedding provider** - One provider behind a clean interface
2. **No plugin hooks for core behavior** - Static, predictable behavior
3. **Vector-only search** - Modern embeddings are sufficient
4. **Cross-agent session access** - Deferred. Essential for power users, but not needed for minimal viable agent. Will add when requirements demand it.
5. **TypeScript with Rust portability** - Distill into TypeScript, but write code that converts easily to Rust. Avoid TypeScript-only tricks; verify heavy dependencies have Rust ecosystem equivalents.
6. **Minimal viable agent** - A CLI where an agent using a Claude subscription can read and write files via tools. We'll refine this definition as we go.
7. **No gateway for minimal scope** - Single-process CLI doesn't need a broker. Design session storage and tool execution so they *could* be fronted by a broker later, but don't build it until needed. If/when we need a broker, prefer local-first IPC (ZeroMQ, Unix sockets) over web-oriented tech (WebSocket, HTTP). The gateway pattern solves multi-client and multi-agent problems we don't have yet.

## Insights Discovered

### From Compaction Analysis

1. **Chunking was over-engineered** - 40% chunk ratio was for 8k-16k context era; modern models don't need it
2. **Token estimation needs margins** - 20% safety buffer is essential (estimation is imprecise)
3. **Metadata survives compaction** - Tool failures and file operations are high-signal information
4. **Layer boundaries matter** - Summarizer shouldn't chunk; that's caller's responsibility

### From OpenClaw AGENTS.md Analysis

The original codebase had **no architectural principles documented**—only operational procedures. This absence likely contributed to complexity accumulation. The distilled system must embed principles alongside code.

### From Gateway Analysis

Traced cross-agent communication in OpenClaw. The gateway is a WebSocket-based JSON-RPC broker that:
- Routes messages between agents via session key prefixes (`agent:<agentId>:...`)
- Maintains combined view of all agent session stores
- Handles multi-client streaming (web, mobile, CLI)
- Enforces auth and access control

**Key insight**: The gateway solves problems that emerge from multi-client and multi-agent requirements. A single-process CLI has none of these problems. The lesson isn't "always use a gateway"—it's "when you need multi-client or multi-agent, you need a broker."

**Design implication**: Keep session storage and tool execution decoupled enough that a broker could be added later without rewriting core logic.

## Next Steps

1. **Decide next component to distill** - Candidates:
   - Context Management (builds on compaction work)
   - Long-term Memory & Search (most isolated)
   - Agent Alignment (defines agent behavior)
   - Session Management (largest, most interconnected)

2. **Consider technology choices** - The distilled system may use:
   - Different language (Rust? Go?)
   - Different storage (SQLite? Postgres?)
   - Different architecture

3. **Establish testing strategy** - How do we validate behavioral equivalence?

## Open Questions

None currently. Cross-agent session access question resolved—deferred until requirements demand it (see decisions #4 and #7).

## Maintaining This File

**This progress file is essential infrastructure.** Without it:
- New sessions start from zero, re-discovering what we already know
- Decisions get revisited unnecessarily
- Context is lost between work sessions

**Update discipline**:
- Add completed work immediately after finishing
- Record insights as they're discovered
- Update open questions as they're resolved
- Keep the "Current Status" line accurate

The goal is that anyone (human or AI) can read this file and understand exactly where we are and what to do next.
