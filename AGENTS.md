# Komatachi (Active Project)

This repository is focused on **Komatachi** - a distillation of OpenClaw being built from the ground up.

## First Action

Read `komatachi/PROGRESS.md` for current state, completed work, and next steps.

## Orientation Before Exploration

This project has thorough documentation. Before launching Explore agents or searching the codebase, **read the docs first**:

1. `komatachi/PROGRESS.md` - covers project state, all completed work, decisions, and insights
2. `komatachi/CLAUDE.md` - covers architecture, coding philosophy, and conventions
3. Relevant `src/*/DECISIONS.md` - covers per-module design rationale

Only use Explore agents for questions the docs don't answer (e.g., tracing specific code paths, finding implementation details). Don't rediscover what's already written down.

## Key Files

- `komatachi/PROGRESS.md` - Source of truth for project state (read this first)
- `komatachi/CLAUDE.md` - Project-specific context
- `komatachi/DISTILLATION.md` - Principles and process
- `komatachi/scouting/` - Analysis of OpenClaw components
- `komatachi/src/` - Distilled implementations

## Style

- No emojis; use markdown checkboxes `[x]` instead
- Document decisions as they're made
- Update PROGRESS.md before each commit

## Git Workflow

- GitHub issues/comments/PR comments: use literal multiline strings or `-F - <<'EOF'` (or $'...') for real newlines; never embed "\\n"
- Follow concise, action-oriented commit messages
- When working on a GitHub Issue or PR, print the full URL at the end of the task

# OpenClaw Reference (Not In Effect)

> **The sections below are OpenClaw documentation preserved for reference only.**
> These instructions are NOT active. Do not follow them for Komatachi work.
> Relevant knowledge will be migrated to the Komatachi section as distillation progresses.

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- Source code: `src/` (CLI wiring in `src/cli`, commands in `src/commands`, web provider in `src/provider-web.ts`, infra in `src/infra`, media pipeline in `src/media`).
- Tests: colocated `*.test.ts`.
- Docs: `docs/` (images, queue, Pi config). Built output lives in `dist/`.
- Plugins/extensions: live under `extensions/*` (workspace packages). Keep plugin-only deps in the extension `package.json`; do not add them to the root `package.json` unless core uses them.
- Plugins: install runs `npm install --omit=dev` in plugin dir; runtime deps must live in `dependencies`. Avoid `workspace:*` in `dependencies` (npm install breaks); put `openclaw` in `devDependencies` or `peerDependencies` instead (runtime resolves `openclaw/plugin-sdk` via jiti alias).
- Installers served from `https://openclaw.ai/*`: live in the sibling repo `../openclaw.ai` (`public/install.sh`, `public/install-cli.sh`, `public/install.ps1`).
- Messaging channels: always consider **all** built-in + extension channels when refactoring shared logic (routing, allowlists, pairing, command gating, onboarding, docs).
  - Core channel docs: `docs/channels/`
  - Core channel code: `src/telegram`, `src/discord`, `src/slack`, `src/signal`, `src/imessage`, `src/web` (WhatsApp web), `src/channels`, `src/routing`
  - Extensions (channel plugins): `extensions/*` (e.g. `extensions/msteams`, `extensions/matrix`, `extensions/zalo`, `extensions/zalouser`, `extensions/voice-call`)
- When adding channels/extensions/apps/docs, review `.github/labeler.yml` for label coverage.



## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- Runtime baseline: Node **22+** (keep Node + Bun paths working).
- Install deps: `pnpm install`
- Pre-commit hooks: `prek install` (runs same checks as CI)
- Also supported: `bun install` (keep `pnpm-lock.yaml` + Bun patching in sync when touching deps/patches).
- Prefer Bun for TypeScript execution (scripts, dev, tests): `bun <file.ts>` / `bunx <tool>`.
- Run CLI in dev: `pnpm openclaw ...` (bun) or `pnpm dev`.
- Node remains supported for running built output (`dist/*`) and production installs.
- Mac packaging (dev): `scripts/package-mac-app.sh` defaults to current arch. Release checklist: `docs/platforms/mac/release.md`.
- Type-check/build: `pnpm build` (tsc)
- Lint/format: `pnpm lint` (oxlint), `pnpm format` (oxfmt)
- Tests: `pnpm test` (vitest); coverage: `pnpm test:coverage`

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Language: TypeScript (ESM). Prefer strict typing; avoid `any`.
- Formatting/linting via Oxlint and Oxfmt; run `pnpm lint` before commits.
- Add brief code comments for tricky or non-obvious logic.
- Keep files concise; extract helpers instead of "V2" copies. Use existing patterns for CLI options and dependency injection via `createDefaultDeps`.
- Aim to keep files under ~700 LOC; guideline only (not a hard guardrail). Split/refactor when it improves clarity or testability.


## Release Channels (Naming)
- stable: tagged releases only (e.g. `vYYYY.M.D`), npm dist-tag `latest`.
- beta: prerelease tags `vYYYY.M.D-beta.N`, npm dist-tag `beta` (may ship without macOS app).
- dev: moving head on `main` (no tag; git checkout main).

## Testing Guidelines
- Framework: Vitest with V8 coverage thresholds (70% lines/branches/functions/statements).
- Naming: match source names with `*.test.ts`; e2e in `*.e2e.test.ts`.
- Run `pnpm test` (or `pnpm test:coverage`) before pushing when you touch logic.
- Do not set test workers above 16; tried already.
- Live tests (real keys): `CLAWDBOT_LIVE_TEST=1 pnpm test:live` (OpenClaw-only) or `LIVE=1 pnpm test:live` (includes provider live tests). Docker: `pnpm test:docker:live-models`, `pnpm test:docker:live-gateway`. Onboarding Docker E2E: `pnpm test:docker:onboard`.
- Full kit + what's covered: `docs/testing.md`.
- Pure test additions/fixes generally do **not** need a changelog entry unless they alter user-facing behavior or the user asks for one.
- Mobile: before using a simulator, check for connected real devices (iOS + Android) and prefer them when available.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Create commits with `scripts/committer "<msg>" <file...>`; avoid manual `git add`/`git commit` so staging stays scoped.
- Follow concise, action-oriented commit messages (e.g., `CLI: add verbose flag to send`).
- Group related changes; avoid bundling unrelated refactors.
- Changelog workflow: keep latest released version at top (no `Unreleased`); after publishing, bump version and start a new top section.
- PRs should summarize scope, note testing performed, and mention any user-facing changes or new flags.
- PR review flow: when given a PR link, review via `gh pr view`/`gh pr diff` and do **not** change branches.
- PR review calls: prefer a single `gh pr view --json ...` to batch metadata/comments; run `gh pr diff` only when needed.
- Before starting a review when a GH Issue/PR is pasted: run `git pull`; if there are local changes or unpushed commits, stop and alert the user before reviewing.
- Goal: merge PRs. Prefer **rebase** when commits are clean; **squash** when history is messy.
- PR merge flow: create a temp branch from `main`, merge the PR branch into it (prefer squash unless commit history is important; use rebase/merge when it is). Always try to merge the PR unless it's truly difficult, then use another approach. If we squash, add the PR author as a co-contributor. Apply fixes, add changelog entry (include PR # + thanks), run full gate before the final commit, commit, merge back to `main`, delete the temp branch, and end on `main`.
- If you review a PR and later do work on it, land via merge/squash (no direct-main commits) and always add the PR author as a co-contributor.
- When working on a PR: add a changelog entry with the PR number and thank the contributor.
- When working on an issue: reference the issue in the changelog entry.
- When merging a PR: leave a PR comment that explains exactly what we did and include the SHA hashes.
- When merging a PR from a new contributor: add their avatar to the README "Thanks to all clawtributors" thumbnail list.
- After merging a PR: run `bun scripts/update-clawtributors.ts` if the contributor is missing, then commit the regenerated README.
